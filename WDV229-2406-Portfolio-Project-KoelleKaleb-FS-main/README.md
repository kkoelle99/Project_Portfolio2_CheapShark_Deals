## üì¢ &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.  
For each Milestone #2-4, you should use all 4 icons.

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week was making all my navigation buttons and routing them to each other.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - The problem I ran into the most was routing everything since it kept giving me errors. I addressed by research the error code until I found the solution I needed.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - Something I "Leveled up" on this week was working with routing I feel a little more comfortable with doing it now.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize next is styling everything to the way I need it to be.

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.  
Post your link here, so you have easy access to it.

- Figma Link

<br>

### Milestone 2

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - The premise of this site is to make a site where gamers could find digital games cheaper than what other places are offering for them.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - Challenges this week was routing and making sure the API worked correctly.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - Accomplishments were getting the API to work correctly and making all the routes work.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps -Next steps are going to be styling everything how I need it to be to look closer to my Figma project. Also getting the Login page and Create account page to work properly.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### Page #1

- Home Page
- Give you just a list of random games to find cheaper prices for.

#### Page #2

- Search
- Allows you to search for a specfic game that you would like to find cheaper.

#### Page #3

- Login Page
- Allows you to login to your account once created. (Not Fully Functional yet)

#### Page #4

- Create Account
- Allows you to Create Account. (not fully functional yet)

#### Remember that creating a project board, issues, and milestones is 50% of your grade!

If you are having trouble, contact your instructor ASAP, you might need to be part of the ePortoflio group to have better access.

<br>

### Milestone 3

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - For this week I worked on setting up better looking styeles and getting the Create account to work with mongo.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - Challenge this week was making sure the project worked every step of the way because I had some hiccups.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - Accomplishments were getting the site back on the right and working again.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - Next steps are finishing whatever has to be done to make a good looking project.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### API

- https://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0
- I chose this API to help video gamers find deals on video games without having to search through google.
- I used the API on the Homepage, the Details page and its also gonna used on the search page.

#### 1st Library

- https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
- Once I resubmit I will add link
- I chose this library because I wanted to attempt something and figured it would work out well with this project.
- Axios is used frequently throughout the entire code.

#### 2nd Library

- https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
- I chose this library to handle the styling of the project.
- Where ever there is styling this library is used.

#### Persistent Data

- I am using MongoDB for this project.
- Its used in the code for keeping track of users username and password
- Currently it is used on the Register page and will be implemented into the Login page.

<br>

### Milestone 4

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - This week I worked on fully styling out my Project.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - A challenge I had was fixing the compiling error I was getting from Milestone 3.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - I accomplished creating a website that works with MongoDB to register an account and Log in from that registration made.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - My next steps are gonna be taking this project and adding more things to it to make it an even better visually looking assignment.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### Changes

- Discuss any changes or updates that you have made to your site since Milestone #3.
- Updates I made from Milestone #3 were fixing the compiling error I was getting and I made it to where the log in section works with the register section to make a Log in and Log out system.

#### Styling

- Discuss the process you used to style your page.
- What I used to style my page Material UI. I had a small hiccup with it since it was trying to get me to use an outdated version of it but now the background and everything else is styled using that.

#### Link To Overview Video

- Once it is created, put the link to your overview video of your site here.

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

- A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
- Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
- A React Front End
- React Routing with _at least_ 4 different views/pages
  - Dashboard/Main
  - User/Settings
  - Search
  - Detail Page
- Node/Express Backend
- A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
- Connect to at least 1 free API
- The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
  - One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
- It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

- Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
  - Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
    - [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)
    - [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)
    - [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)
- Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.
- Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
  - Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)\*\*\*\*

- Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
- Start to code your project.
  - I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
  - At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
- Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
- By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)\*\*\*\*

- By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
- Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)\*\*\*\*

- Your completed project will be due.
- You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
  - Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
